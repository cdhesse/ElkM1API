ElkM1API
========

Java library to interact with the Elk M1XEP RS232 protocol.  

Both secure port and default port connections work.  Check the cdh test package for help obtaining the cert from your M1XEP.

This project does not have all of the message types implemented, but would implement a missing one if someone asked me to.  I personally don't have much time dedicated to this so unless I get direct requests, there probably won't be many updates.  

I would be happy if others want to contribute.
