ElkM1API
========

Java library to interact with the Elk M1XEP RS232 protocol.  

Both secure port and default port connections work.  Check the cdh test package for help obtaining the cert from your M1XEP.

This project does not have all of the message types implemented, but would implement a missing one if someone asked me to.
